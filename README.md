# Bluetooth-rotary-dial

These sketches are intended to transform and old rotary dial phone in a bluetooth terminal of a smartphone.
The rotary phone will be able to send and receive communication and the rotary dial is functional (able to compose a phone number).

The hardware is made of a STM32 Bluepill connected to a BT201 Bluetooth module.

Another similar realisation is made with an Arduino nano and a Purpletooth Jamboree module from Sparkfun
